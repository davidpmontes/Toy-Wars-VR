See the demo video on YouTube [HERE](https://youtu.be/x6Y6ELFt32g)

Join forces with Captain Stiffneck and his team for the battle of the bedroom!  You'll first prove your skills against time-based popup targets.  Then you'll be thrown into action as you blast away with your ping-pong launching turret to defend your base against an onslaught of flying wooden toys!  Keep an eye out for hidden collectibles along the way and get a kick out of the wacky voice overs.  GLHF!

This demo game was created with Unity 3D.  It was a term project for Professor Robert Bruce's and Lecturer Nanci Solomon's CMPE 297 Special Topics - Virtual Reality class for Fall 2019.  The game was originally designed with Steam VR to be used with the HTC Vive.  It was modified for this video to work with an XBOXOne gamepad.  All assets were purchased through online stores including the Unity Asset Store and Turbo Squid.
